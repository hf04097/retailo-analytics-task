All question are attempted using sql queries and Python (pandas library mostly). A .ipynb file is added to show the working done in .ipynb file.

For sql queries, [sql server management studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15 "sql server management studio") (SSMS) is used along with [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads "SQL Server").  To import excel file into SSMS, steps mentioned [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39610133/how-can-i-import-an-excel-file-into-sql-server "here") were followed.

For each question a seperate .sql file is created with the naming format like 'retailo_q1' where 1 represents the number of the question.

For better visiblity **please** view the Retailo-Analytics Assignment filled (solution).xlsx [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PLbwJFIabCwrJsmtoBICbGXGjjcMTYIs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103392334977537341573&rtpof=true&sd=true "here") . Converting from google sheets to excel file messed up the formatting.
